Subject: arXiv endorsement request for <ARXIV_CATEGORY> submission

Dear [Endorser Name],

I'm requesting your endorsement to submit a paper to arXiv in <ARXIV_CATEGORY>.

**Paper:** <PAPER_TITLE>

**What this is:**
- A deterministic debt-ledger framework for RH-related verification
- A reproducibility ladder with auditable artifacts
- Fully verifiable: `<VERIFY_COMMAND>`

**What this is NOT:**
<NON_CLAIMS_BULLETS>

**Materials:**
- Repository: <REPO_RELEASE_LINK>
- Paper PDF: `paper/main.pdf` in the release
- SHA256 digest published in R25

I'm forwarding the official arXiv endorsement email below. The link in that email will allow you to endorse my submission if you choose to do so.

Endorsement attests only that the submission is appropriate for the category and that I appear to be a serious researcher — it does not constitute review or agreement with the content.

Thank you for considering this request. I understand if you're unable to help.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
