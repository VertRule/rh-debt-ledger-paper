Hi [Name],

I'm an independent researcher submitting a paper on deterministic verification frameworks for RH computations to arXiv (math.NT). I noticed your work on [relevant topic] and wondered if you might be willing to provide an endorsement.

This is NOT a proof claim — it's a reproducibility/audit framework with a verification ladder.

Repo: [REPO_LINK]

If you're open to it, I can send the arXiv endorsement link via email. No pressure either way.

Thanks for your time.
