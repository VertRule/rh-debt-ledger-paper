Subject: arXiv endorsement request — quick ask

Hi [Name],

I'm submitting a paper on deterministic verification frameworks for RH computations to arXiv (<ARXIV_CATEGORY>) and need an endorsement.

**Key points:**
- This is NOT a proof claim — it's a reproducibility/audit framework
- Fully verifiable: `VR_STRICT=1 ./VERIFY.sh`
- Repo: <REPO_RELEASE_LINK>

I'm forwarding the arXiv endorsement email below. The link lets you endorse if you're willing.

No worries if you can't — I appreciate your time either way.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
