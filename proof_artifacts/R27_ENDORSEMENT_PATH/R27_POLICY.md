# R27 Policy: Endorsement Outreach

## Core Principles

1. **Honesty First** — Never imply this paper proves or verifies RH
2. **Low Ego** — Request is for topical endorsement, not mathematical validation
3. **Respect Time** — Keep outreach concise; provide all materials upfront
4. **One-Shot** — Maximum one follow-up if no response; accept decline gracefully
5. **Token Safety** — Never publish endorsement codes publicly

## What We Are Asking

An arXiv endorsement attests that:
- The submission is appropriate for the category (e.g., math.NT)
- The author appears to be a serious researcher
- The content is not spam or crankery

An endorsement does **not** attest that:
- The mathematics is correct
- The results are novel
- The endorser agrees with the approach

## Token Handling Rules

arXiv endorsement emails contain sensitive one-time tokens. Rules:
- **Never** commit tokens to version control
- **Never** post tokens publicly (GitHub issues, Twitter, etc.)
- Store tokens only in operator-private notes
- Prefer forwarding the original arXiv email with a cover note
- Verify URLs point to `arxiv.org` domain before sharing

## Outreach Constraints

- Maximum **one** initial contact per potential endorser
- If no response in 5–7 days, send **one** polite follow-up
- After follow-up, stop — do not contact again
- Provide endorsement link, paper PDF, and repo in first message
- Do not pressure, guilt, or repeatedly contact
- Accept silence or decline gracefully

## Non-Claims Checklist

All outreach must include or reference:
- [ ] "This paper makes no proof claims"
- [ ] "This is a verification/reproducibility framework"
- [ ] "Endorsement does not constitute mathematical review"

## Parallel Dissemination

While awaiting arXiv endorsement, the paper may be deposited on:
- Zenodo (DOI-minting, permanent archival)
- OSF Preprints (optional mirror)

This ensures public citability without arXiv access.
