# Endorsement Packet

## What This Is

A deterministic verification ladder and debt-ledger framework for Riemann Hypothesis computations. The repository provides auditable proof artifacts with cryptographic receipts, reproducible builds, and structured accounting of what remains unproven.

## What This Is NOT

- **Not a proof of RH** — we make no such claim
- **Not new bounds** — we do not extend Platt, Trudgian, or others
- **Not a substitute for peer review** — external audit is pending
- **Not speculative mathematics** — no unproven conjectures assumed

## What You Are Endorsing

Endorsement attests that the submission is appropriate for the category (math.NT). It does **not** constitute review, agreement with the approach, or validation of correctness. You are endorsing my ability to submit, not the content.

## Materials

**Repository:**
https://github.com/VertRule/rh-debt-ledger-paper

**Verification command:**
```
VR_STRICT=1 ./VERIFY.sh
```
Expected output: `25/25 PASS`

**Paper PDF:**
`paper/main.pdf` in the repository

**Zenodo DOI (citable):**
10.5281/zenodo.18318663

## Endorsement Process

I will forward the official arXiv endorsement email separately. That email contains a one-time link you can use to endorse the submission. Please verify the email originates from `arxiv.org` before clicking.
