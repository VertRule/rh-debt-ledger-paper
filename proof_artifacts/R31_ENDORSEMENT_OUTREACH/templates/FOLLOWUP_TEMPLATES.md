## Follow-up #1 (T+6 days)

**Subject:** Re: arXiv endorsement request (math.NT)

Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up on my endorsement request from [DATE]. No pressure—I know you're busy.

As a reminder: this is a verification-ladder framework for RH computations, not a proof claim. Endorsement only attests the submission fits math.NT; it does not constitute review or agreement.

Details: https://github.com/VertRule/rh-debt-ledger-paper/blob/main/proof_artifacts/R31_ENDORSEMENT_OUTREACH/ENDORSEMENT_PACKET.md

I can resend the arXiv token email if helpful.

Regards,
Dave

## Follow-up #2 (T+14 days, final)

**Subject:** Re: arXiv endorsement request (math.NT) — final note

Hi [Name],

Final follow-up on my math.NT endorsement request. Completely understand if you're unable to help.

The submission is a reproducibility framework, not a proof claim. Details in the packet linked previously.

I can resend the arXiv email if needed. Either way, thanks for your time.

Regards,
Dave
