Subject: arXiv endorsement request for <ARXIV_CATEGORY> submission

Dear [Endorser Name],

I'm requesting your endorsement to submit a paper to arXiv in <ARXIV_CATEGORY>.

**Paper:** <PAPER_TITLE>

**What this is:**
- A deterministic debt-ledger framework for RH-related verification
- A reproducibility ladder with auditable artifacts
- Fully verifiable: `<VERIFY_COMMAND>`

**What this is NOT:**
- Not a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis
- Not a new bound on prime counting
- Not a claim of RH verification beyond known checks
- Not a substitute for peer review

**Materials:**
- Repository: https://github.com/VertRule/rh-debt-ledger-paper
- Release: <REPO_RELEASE>
- Paper PDF: `paper/main.pdf`

**Official arXiv endorsement email will be forwarded separately.**

The endorsement link in that email will allow you to endorse my submission. Endorsement attests only that the submission is appropriate for the category — it does not constitute review or agreement.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
