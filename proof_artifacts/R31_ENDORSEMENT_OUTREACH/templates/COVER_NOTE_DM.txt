Hi [Name],

I'm submitting a paper on deterministic verification frameworks for RH computations to arXiv (<ARXIV_CATEGORY>). Would you consider providing an endorsement?

This is NOT a proof claim — it's a reproducibility/audit framework.

Repo: https://github.com/VertRule/rh-debt-ledger-paper
Verify: VR_STRICT=1 ./VERIFY.sh

If you're open to it, I can email the official arXiv endorsement link. No pressure either way.

Thanks.
