# One-Page Pitch: RH Debt-Ledger Framework

## What It Is

A **deterministic debt-ledger** and **verification ladder** for Riemann Hypothesis computations.

- Auditable proof artifacts with cryptographic receipts
- Reproducible builds (bit-for-bit identical outputs)
- Structured "debt" accounting of what remains unproven
- 30+ verification rungs, each building on the last

## What It Is NOT

- **Not a proof of RH** — we make no such claim
- **Not a new zero-verification bound** — we do not extend Platt or others
- **Not an RH verification claim** — the paper documents a framework, not a result
- **Not speculative mathematics** — no unproven conjectures are assumed

## How to Verify

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VertRule/rh-debt-ledger-paper
cd rh-debt-ledger-paper
VR_STRICT=1 ./VERIFY.sh
```

Expected output: `25/25 PASS`

## Why Endorse

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Topicality | Squarely in number theory / numerical analysis |
| Seriousness | 30+ verification rungs, deterministic builds |
| Auditability | Every claim is machine-verifiable |
| Non-crankery | Explicit non-claims, no proof assertions |

Endorsement does NOT mean you agree with the approach or vouch for correctness — only that the submission is appropriate for the category.
