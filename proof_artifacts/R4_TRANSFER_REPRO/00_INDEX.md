# R4 Transfer Reproduction Slice

**Concept-Tag:** RH-R4-TRANSFER-INDEX

## Purpose

This packet reproduces the transfer step from a bound on ψ(x) to a bound on π(x)−Li(x). It is a self-contained derivation slice under declared assumptions.

## Non-Claims

- No RH claim
- No zero-free region claim
- No numeric constants asserted
