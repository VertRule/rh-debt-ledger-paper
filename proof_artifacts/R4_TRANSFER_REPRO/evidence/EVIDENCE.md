# R4 Evidence Ledger

**Concept-Tag:** RH-R4-EVIDENCE-LEDGER

## Citation Entries

### ID R4.3

**Worklist ID:** R4.3

**Task:** Add citation anchors for Stieltjes / partial summation lemma

**What is being cited:** The partial summation formula (Abel's summation formula) and its Stieltjes integral formulation, used to transfer bounds between arithmetic functions and their integral representations.

**Citation:**
- Davenport, H. (2000). *Multiplicative Number Theory* (3rd ed., revised by H. L. Montgomery). Springer. Chapter 17.
- Montgomery, H. L., & Vaughan, R. C. (2007). *Multiplicative Number Theory I: Classical Theory*. Cambridge University Press. Section 1.3.

**Evidence type:** CITATION-ONLY

**Claim scope:** Does not reproduce proof of partial summation; only anchors standard reference for the identity used in 01_PARTIAL_SUMMATION.md.

### ID R4.C2

**Worklist ID:** (future)

**Task:** Citation anchor for ψ/θ/π relations

**What is being cited:** The standard relations between Chebyshev functions ψ(x), θ(x) and the prime counting function π(x).

**Citation:**
- Titchmarsh, E. C. (1986). *The Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function* (2nd ed., revised by D. R. Heath-Brown). Oxford University Press. Chapter 1.

**Evidence type:** CITATION-ONLY

**Claim scope:** Does not reproduce derivations; only anchors standard reference for the functional relations assumed in R4_CONTRACT.md.

### ID R4.1

**Worklist ID:** R4.1

**Task:** Make prime-power correction explicit: define Δ_pp(x) precisely

**What is being cited:** Standard definitions and relations among Chebyshev functions ψ(x), θ(x), and π(x), including explicit accounting for prime powers and the correction term when transferring bounds from ψ/θ to π(x)−Li(x).

**Citation:**
- Davenport, H. (2000). *Multiplicative Number Theory* (3rd ed., revised by H. L. Montgomery). Springer. (Chebyshev functions ψ, θ; relation to π; treatment of prime powers).
- Montgomery, H. L., & Vaughan, R. C. (2007). *Multiplicative Number Theory I: Classical Theory*. Cambridge University Press. (ψ/θ/π relations; explicit formula context; prime powers).
- Ivić, A. (1985). *The Riemann Zeta-Function*. Wiley. (Chebyshev functions; prime powers; explicit formula usage).

**Evidence type:** CITATION-ONLY

**Claim scope:** Does not reproduce proof; anchors standard reference for defining and handling the prime-power correction term (Δ_pp) in the ψ→π transfer. No bound asserted here.
