# R7: Instantiated Bound Statement

**Concept-Tag:** RH-R7-INDEX

## Purpose

R7 provides a single tamper-evident statement of the fully instantiated bound for |π(x) − Li(x)| with all terms explicit.

This is the culmination of R4 (transfer template), R5 (source menu), and R6 (instantiation record).

## Non-Claims

- No RH claim
- No new analytic bounds beyond cited sources
- Constants/thresholds remain explicit debt
- This is a statement artifact, not a proof
