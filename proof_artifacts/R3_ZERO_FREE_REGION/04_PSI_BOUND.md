# ψ(x) Bound

**Concept-Tag:** RH-R3-PSI-BOUND

## Claim

TBD (debt): Combining Steps 1–3, establish |ψ(x) − x| ≤ x · exp(−c · (log x)^α) for sufficiently large x.

## Inputs / Outputs

- **Input:** Explicit formula (Step 2), zero sum bound (Step 3)
- **Output:** Error bound for ψ(x)

## Dependencies

- Steps 1–3 of this packet
- Standard analytic number theory estimates

## Debt Ledger

- [ ] Exponent α not derived
- [ ] Constant c not derived
- [ ] "Sufficiently large" threshold not quantified
- [ ] Full assembly of steps not written out

## Non-Claims

- Bound is weaker than RH (which would give O(x^(1/2+ε)))
- No novel techniques claimed
