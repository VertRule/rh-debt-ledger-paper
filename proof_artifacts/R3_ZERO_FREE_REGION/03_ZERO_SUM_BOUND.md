# Zero Sum Bound

**Concept-Tag:** RH-R3-ZERO-SUM-BOUND

## Claim

TBD (debt): Given the zero-free region R, bound the contribution of |Σ_ρ (x^ρ / ρ)| where the sum runs over non-trivial zeros.

## Inputs / Outputs

- **Input:** Zero-free region R (from Step 1), explicit formula (from Step 2)
- **Output:** Bound on |Σ_ρ (x^ρ / ρ)| as a function of x

## Dependencies

- Zero-free region lemma (01)
- Zero-counting function N(T)
- Partial summation / contour truncation

## Debt Ledger

- [ ] Bound not yet stated
- [ ] Truncation height T(x) not chosen
- [ ] Error from truncation not quantified
- [ ] Dependence on zero-free region constants not made explicit

## Non-Claims

- No explicit bound claimed until debt is paid
- Does not improve known results
